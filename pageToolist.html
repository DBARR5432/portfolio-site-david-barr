                Toolist is an online tool, appliance, and housewares store designed for people who want a simplified shopping experience, 
                and may not be as comfortable with technology as the average person.

                For the research portion I focused on the e-commerce apps of the four most popular housewares retailers in my area. Several 
                common patterns were found and utilized in this project. Most notably the top and bottom navigation bars between all four apps
                were esentially slight variations of one another.

                    From the greyscale wireframes, color and typography were applied. A simple palette of red, yellow, and grey was chosen 
                    in order to reduce visual noise and help keep things simple. A page showing similar items that confirms the item being
                    added to the cart, as well as a couple more screens aiding checkout confirmation were all added.

                    As with everything else I've done, the prototype feedback was invaluable to the final design. Among other things, the
                    biggest improvements were made in the realm of color choice, and placement of UI elements. Usage of margins was pointed
                    out particularly by one of my testers, and that awareness greatly helped this project.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p class="indent">
                    The overall challenge with this project was having a large amount of potential functionalities on each screen, as 
                    opposed to spreading those individual functionalities to their own screens as I’ve done more in the past. Having an 
                    idea of where I wanted elements was no guarantee that it would work out that well once I actually started making digital 
                    wireframes, so there was a lot of back and forth between my reference material and the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                    I found utilizing the color palette to be fairly difficult as well. The colors I felt all worked well together in 
                    example images, yet for the purpose of an e-commerce app things didn’t fall into place the way I’d have preferred. My 
                    secondary color was difficult to work with and the alternate secondary color I don’t believe ended up being used 
                    effectively anywhere in the final design. 
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column col-md-6"><!--Takeaways-->
                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p class="indent">
                    As with every project I’ve worked on so far, I’ve found that the user testing did the most in terms of altering the 
                    design for the better. 
                    <p class="indent">
                    I have also learned that I should probably start trusting myself when I feel something looks “off” about the design, 
                    even if I’ve rationalized the decision to myself in some way. For this project an example of that would be the 
                    light-yellow used in the header in my initial high-fidelity prototype. I felt it didn’t work well, but was determined 
                    to utilize the secondary color in the design. This basically resulted in my accepting of something that aesthetically 
                    wasn’t as optimal because I “wanted” to make sure all of my palette was utilized.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                    Another concept the user testing had me thinking about more than I had been was the usage of margins, and how those 
                    margins can be used to convey a hierarchy of information. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                    I think at first these changes may appear smaller, but to the overall effect of the product the have a large impact. 
                    I think the skills I’ve developed up to this point have allowed for these considerations to be made, and I will 
                    definitely be remembering what I’ve learned with this project going forward.
